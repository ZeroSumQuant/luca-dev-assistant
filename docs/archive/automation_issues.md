# Automation Safeguard Issues for LUCA

## Priority 1: Critical Safety Infrastructure

### Issue 1: Create safety-check.sh Script
**Title**: Create comprehensive safety-check.sh script for pre-commit validation
**Labels**: automation, critical-safety, infrastructure
**Description**:
Create a comprehensive safety check script that enforces all quality gates before any commit. This is critical for life-safety system integrity.

**Requirements**:
- Check current directory is project root
- Verify virtual environment is activated
- Run black formatting check
- Run isort import check
- Run flake8 linting
- Run bandit security scan
- Run pytest with 95% coverage requirement
- Verify documentation is updated (task_log.md and handoff)
- Clear pass/fail output with color coding

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Script exits with error on any check failure
- All checks must pass for success
- Clear error messages for each failure type
- Documentation on how to fix each type of failure

### Issue 2: Implement Pre-push Git Hook
**Title**: Add git pre-push hook to prevent unsafe code reaching repository
**Labels**: automation, critical-safety, git
**Description**:
Implement a git pre-push hook that runs safety-check.sh and blocks pushes if any checks fail. Critical for preventing untested code from reaching the repository.

**Requirements**:
- Create .git/hooks/pre-push script
- Must run safety-check.sh before allowing push
- Block push on any failure
- Provide clear error messages
- Include installation script for easy setup

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Hook prevents pushes when tests fail
- Hook prevents pushes when coverage < 95%
- Hook prevents pushes when documentation not updated
- Clear instructions for bypass in emergencies only

### Issue 3: Create Makefile for Standardized Commands
**Title**: Add Makefile with common development commands
**Labels**: automation, developer-experience
**Description**:
Create a Makefile that standardizes common commands to reduce errors and improve consistency.

**Requirements**:
- Target: `make test` - run all tests
- Target: `make lint` - run all linters
- Target: `make safety` - run safety-check.sh
- Target: `make clean` - remove generated files
- Target: `make docs` - check documentation
- Target: `make all` - run full safety check

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All targets work correctly
- Proper dependency chain
- Clear help text
- Documented in README

## Priority 2: Documentation Automation

### Issue 4: Automated Documentation Checker
**Title**: Create script to verify documentation is current
**Labels**: automation, documentation
**Description**:
Build a script that verifies task_log.md and handoff documents are updated for current date.

**Requirements**:
- Check task_log.md has entry for today
- Check handoff document exists for today
- Provide specific guidance on what's missing
- Integrate with safety-check.sh

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Correctly identifies missing documentation
- Provides clear instructions for fixes
- Can be run standalone or integrated

### Issue 5: Coverage Report Generator
**Title**: Implement coverage tracking with trend analysis
**Labels**: automation, testing, metrics
**Description**:
Create automated coverage reporting that tracks trends and fails on regression below 95%.

**Requirements**:
- Generate coverage reports after each test run
- Track coverage trends over time
- Fail if coverage drops below 95%
- Generate coverage badges for README
- Store historical data

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Accurate coverage reporting
- Trend visualization
- Automatic badge generation
- Integration with CI/CD

## Priority 3: CI/CD Implementation

### Issue 6: GitHub Actions CI Workflow
**Title**: Create comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
**Labels**: automation, ci-cd, infrastructure
**Description**:
Implement GitHub Actions workflow that runs all safety checks on every PR and push.

**Requirements**:
- Run on Python 3.13
- Execute all safety checks
- Generate coverage reports
- Block merge on any failure
- Cache dependencies for speed
- Run on multiple OS if needed

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All PRs must pass CI
- Clear failure messages
- Fast execution time
- Proper caching

### Issue 7: Dependency Security Scanner
**Title**: Add automated security scanning for dependencies
**Labels**: automation, security, dependencies
**Description**:
Implement automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies with alerts and automated updates.

### Issue 8: Pre-commit Hook Configuration
**Title**: Enhance pre-commit configuration for all checks
**Labels**: automation, developer-experience
**Description**:
Update .pre-commit-config.yaml to include all safety checks and ensure consistency.

**Requirements**:
- Include all current linters
- Add documentation checks
- Add security scans
- Ensure fast execution
- Clear error messages

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All checks run in pre-commit
- Fast execution time
