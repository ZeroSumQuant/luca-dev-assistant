**Areas to Address:**

- tools/file_io.py
- tools/git_tools.py
- tools/mcp_client.py
- tools/mcp_autogen_bridge.py

**Example of Current Implementation:**

```python
def read_text(path):
    """Read a UTF-8 text file."""
    with open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        return f.read()
```

**Example of Improved Implementation:**

```python
def read_text(path: str) -> str:
    """Read a UTF-8 text file."""
    with open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        return f.read()
```

**Labels:** technical-debt, type-hints, code-quality, medium-priority

- Network requests

**Example of Current Implementation:**

```python
def make_api_call(endpoint):
    response = requests.get(endpoint)
    data = response.json()
    return data
```

**Example of Improved Implementation:**

```python
def make_api_call(endpoint):
    try:
        response = requests.get(endpoint, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"API request failed: {e}")
        raise APIConnectionError(f"Failed to connect to {endpoint}: {e}") from e
    except ValueError as e:
        logger.error(f"Invalid response format: {e}")
        raise APIResponseError(f"Invalid response from {endpoint}: {e}") from e
```

    if not user_input or len(user_input) > 1000:
        raise ValueError("User input must be 1-1000 characters")
    
    # Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks
    sanitized_input = sanitize_input(user_input)
    
    # Process the input
    return process_input(sanitized_input)
```

**Labels:** security, input-validation, medium-priority
