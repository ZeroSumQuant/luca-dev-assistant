# LUCA Sandbox Resource Limits

This document defines the default resource limits for LUCA's sandboxed execution environment. These limits are designed to ensure safe and controlled execution of user-provided code while preventing resource exhaustion or system abuse.

## Default Resource Limits

### CPU
- **Limit**: 1 core
- **Rationale**: Prevents CPU-intensive operations from affecting system performance
- **Implementation**: Process affinity and CPU quota controls

### Memory
- **Limit**: 1024 MB (1 GB)
- **Rationale**: Sufficient for most development tasks while preventing memory exhaustion
- **Implementation**: Memory cgroup limits or process memory limits

### Disk
- **Limit**: 512 MB
- **Rationale**: Allows temporary file operations while preventing disk space exhaustion
- **Implementation**: Filesystem quotas or temporary directory size limits

### Network
- **Default**: Offline (no network access)
- **Rationale**: Prevents unauthorized network access and data exfiltration
- **Implementation**: Network namespace isolation or firewall rules

## Configuration

These limits can be configured through environment variables or configuration files:

```yaml
sandbox:
  resources:
    cpu_cores: 1
    memory_mb: 1024
    disk_mb: 512
    network_enabled: false
```

## Override Mechanism

For specific use cases requiring different limits:

1. **Development Mode**: Relaxed limits for trusted local development
2. **Production Mode**: Strict enforcement of all limits
3. **Custom Profiles**: Task-specific resource profiles

## Monitoring and Enforcement

- Resource usage is monitored in real-time
- Processes exceeding limits are terminated gracefully
- All resource violations are logged for security audit

## Security Considerations

- All sandbox operations run with minimal privileges
- No access to host system resources outside defined limits
- Isolated filesystem namespace prevents access to sensitive files
- Network isolation prevents unauthorized communication

## Future Enhancements

- Dynamic resource allocation based on task requirements
- User-specific resource quotas
- Time-based execution limits
- GPU resource management (when applicable)
