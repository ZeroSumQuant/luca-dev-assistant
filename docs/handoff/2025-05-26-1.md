# Handoff Document - 2025-05-26

## Session Summary

Improved the CLAUDE.md workflow documentation to clarify when safety-check.sh should be run. The safety check was previously required at every session start, which created unnecessary noise when no work had been done yet. Updated the documentation to specify that safety-check.sh should only run before commits, making the developer workflow more logical and less noisy.

## Work Completed

### 1. CLAUDE.md Workflow Clarification
- Removed safety-check.sh from the "Every Session Start" section in CLAUDE.md
- Updated the "ALWAYS DO" section to specify "BEFORE COMMITS" instead of "EVERY SESSION"
- Created new branch: claude-2025-05-26-safety-check-workflow
- Verified all 305 tests pass after changes
- Updated task log with completed work

## Key Decisions

- Decided that safety-check.sh is a pre-commit gate, not a session starter
- Kept safety-check.sh mandatory before commits to maintain quality standards
- Made the workflow more developer-friendly by reducing unnecessary noise

## Current State

- All tests passing (305 tests)
- Documentation updated in CLAUDE.md
- Task log updated for 2025-05-26
- Handoff document created with proper schema compliance
- Branch claude-2025-05-26-safety-check-workflow ready for PR

## Next Steps

1. Create PR for the CLAUDE.md workflow improvement
2. Review automation issues from CLAUDE.md that need implementation (#68, #71, #72, #73)
3. Consider working on other open issues from the repository
4. Merge PR once approved

## Issues/Concerns

- None identified - this was a straightforward documentation improvement

## For Next Session

- Review the 30 open issues and prioritize which to tackle next
- Focus on automation issues #68, #71, #72, or #73 from CLAUDE.md
- Check if any new issues or PRs have been created
