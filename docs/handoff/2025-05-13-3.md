# Handoff Report - 2025-05-13 (Part 3)

## Summary

Added type hints to key functions in the tools directory as specified in issue #22. This improves code maintainability and helps catch potential issues earlier in the development process.

## Tasks Completed

1. Created branch `claude-2025-05-13-add-type-hints` for adding type hints
2. Added comprehensive type hints to all functions in:
   - `tools/file_io.py`
   - `tools/git_tools.py`
   - `tools/mcp_client.py`
   - `tools/mcp_autogen_bridge.py`
   - `tools/changelog_helper.py`
3. Enhanced function documentation with detailed parameter and return type descriptions
4. Fixed unused imports and addressed code style issues
5. Confirmed all tests pass with the added type hints
6. Ensured code complies with project's flake8 standards

## Implementation Details

- Added proper return type annotations to all functions
- Used Optional and Union types where appropriate
- Created custom type aliases for complex types (ToolResult, ToolExecutor, etc.)
- Added detailed docstrings following standard format
- Ensured line lengths conform to project standards

## Issues Encountered

- Some functions required documentation refactoring to fit within line length limits
- Minor issues with unused imports that needed to be addressed

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push changes to the repository
2. Create a pull request to close issue #22
3. Consider adding type hints to other parts of the codebase for consistency
