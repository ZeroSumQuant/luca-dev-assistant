## Session Summary
Resolved Issue #55 (CI-DEBT-#4: type hygiene for store.py) by removing mypy exclusions from the configuration. The file already had proper type annotations and passed all type checks, so only the configuration update was needed.

## Work Completed

### 1. Mypy Configuration Cleanup (Issue #55)
- Removed `ignore_errors = True` for `luca_core.context.store` from `.config/mypy.ini`
- Verified store.py passes mypy checks in both standard and strict modes
- Confirmed no `type: ignore` comments exist in the file
- Ran all context store tests to ensure functionality remains intact (7/7 tests pass)

## Current State
- **Working**: Type checking for store.py is now enabled and passing
- **Broken**: None
- **Blocked**: None

## Next Steps
- Close Issue #55 as completed
- Next priority: Issue #54 (CI-DEBT-#3: Fix legacy async tests)
- After CI debt: Issue #59 (PH1-4: Improved logging and monitoring)

## Critical Notes
- The issue was simpler than expected - the code was already properly typed
- Only the mypy configuration needed updating
- This demonstrates good code quality in the existing implementation
