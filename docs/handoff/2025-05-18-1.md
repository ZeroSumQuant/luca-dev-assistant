# Handoff: 2025-05-18-1

## Completed

- **Fixed AutoGen Mock Interference in CI** (PR #76)
  - Added `disable_autogen_mock` fixture to `tests/core/test_registry_execute.py`
  - Removed `pyautogen==0.9.0` from requirements.txt (AG2 fork)
  - Created RESEARCH folder structure at `/RESEARCH/`
  - Documented findings in `/RESEARCH/autogen-mocking/2025-05-18-autogen-ci-mock-interference.md`
  - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with mocking behavior guidance
  - Created reusable fixtures in `tests/fixtures.py`

## Status

- **Working**: 
  - Registry execute tests pass locally with fixture
  - AutoGen mocking properly isolated to specific tests
  - Pre-commit hooks all passing
  
- **Broken**: 
  - None identified
  
- **Blocked**: 
  - Local pip uninstall of pyautogen had errors (but dependency removed from requirements.txt)

## Critical Notes

- **Root Cause**: AutoGen's `AUTOGEN_USE_MOCK_RESPONSE=1` in CI globally patches functions
- **Fix**: Targeted fixture disables mock mode only where needed
- **Dependency Issue**: Both `pyautogen` (AG2 fork) and `autogen-agentchat` were installed
- **Research**: Deep investigation documented for future reference

## Next Session

1. Monitor CI results for PR #76
2. If CI passes, merge PR #76
3. Continue with originally planned work:
   - Address any remaining CI issues
   - Work on next feature/fix in backlog
4. Consider full venv rebuild to clean pip issues
