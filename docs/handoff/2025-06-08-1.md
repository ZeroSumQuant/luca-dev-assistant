## Session Summary

Fixed CI hanging issue in the test-and-build job that was causing the PR #132 CI to hang indefinitely.

## Key Changes

### Fixed Hanging Tests
- **Issue**: CI was hanging on "Run all tests with coverage" step for over 2 hours
- **Root Cause**: RestrictedPythonExecutor uses daemon threads that continue running infinite loops even after timeout
- **Solution**: Replaced `while True: pass` with `for i in range(10**9): pass` in timeout tests
  - Modified `tests/test_sandbox_manager.py` line 293
  - Modified `tests/test_sandbox_manager_coverage.py` line 77
- **Additional**: Enhanced thread diagnostics in `tests/conftest.py` to log hanging threads

### Research Applied
- Based on comprehensive research document about CI-safe async integration testing
- Key insight: Python threads cannot be forcefully killed, so infinite loops in threads will hang CI
- Using finite loops ensures threads eventually complete even if not properly terminated

## Test Results
- All tests passing locally with 96% coverage
- Pre-commit hooks passing (black, isort, flake8, bandit, mypy)
- Coverage remains above 95% threshold

## Next Steps
1. Monitor CI to confirm the hanging issue is resolved
2. If CI still hangs, consider using subprocess isolation for problematic tests
3. Consider implementing pytest-timeout plugin as recommended in research
