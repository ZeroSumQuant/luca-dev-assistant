# Handoff Document - 2025-05-26

## Session Summary

Created automation helper scripts for Claude instances and updated CLAUDE.md to reflect completed automation issues. During the session, discovered the importance of always pulling latest main before creating branches to avoid merge conflicts. Created two helper scripts that provide prescriptive guidance to Claude instances, helping prevent common mistakes especially when multiple instances work in parallel.

## Work Completed

### 1. Verified Automation Issues Status
- Checked issues #68, #71, #72, #73 from CLAUDE.md
- Confirmed all are already implemented and closed
- Updated CLAUDE.md to mark them as [✓ COMPLETED]

### 2. Created Helper Scripts
- **branch-check.sh**: Checks if current branch is behind main
  - Provides prescriptive instructions on how to update
  - Reminds to check CLAUDE.md for complete workflow
  - Exits with error if branch is outdated
- **claude-startup.sh**: Comprehensive preflight checklist
  - Verifies correct directory
  - Checks virtual environment is active
  - Confirms Python 3.13 is being used
  - Runs branch status check
  - Provides useful command reminders
  - Shows key workflow reminders

### 3. Best Practice Implementation
- Demonstrated proper workflow: stash → checkout main → pull → create branch → apply stash
- This prevents merge conflicts when creating PRs
- Both PR #104 and this work used proper workflow

## Key Decisions

- Helper scripts should be prescriptive, not just informative
- Scripts should remind Claude to check CLAUDE.md for complete workflow
- Better to have gentle reminders than complex automation
- These helpers complement existing guardrails without adding complexity

## Current State

- All tests passing (305 tests, 97.34% coverage)
- CLAUDE.md updated with completed issue status
- Two new executable helper scripts added
- Task log updated
- Branch claude-2025-05-26-automation-helpers pushed and ready for PR

## Next Steps

1. Create PR for automation helpers branch
2. Test helper scripts with Claude Squad instances
3. Consider adding more helpers if pain points are discovered
4. Update CLAUDE.md startup section to mention claude-startup.sh

## Issues/Concerns

- None - the helper scripts are lightweight and optional

## For Next Session

- Monitor how well the helper scripts work for the Claude Squad
- Consider adding the helpers to the standard workflow in CLAUDE.md
- Look for other common pain points that could benefit from automation
