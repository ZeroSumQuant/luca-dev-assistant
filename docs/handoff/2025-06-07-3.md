## Session Summary

Implemented issue #60 (PH2-2: sandbox limits module) and significantly improved test coverage for core modules from 97% to 98%. Created comprehensive resource limits configuration for sandbox execution with proper validation and trust-based presets. Added extensive test coverage for previously untested code paths.

## Work Completed

### 1. Issue #60: Sandbox Limits Module
- **Created `luca_core/sandbox/limits.py`** with resource limit configuration:
  - ResourceLimits dataclass with immutable configuration
  - Default limits as specified: CPU=1, MEM_MB=1024, DISK_MB=512, NET_OFFLINE=True
  - Strict limits for untrusted code (0.5 CPU, 256MB RAM, etc.)
  - Relaxed limits for trusted code (2 CPU, 2048MB RAM, network enabled)
  
- **LimitsValidator class** for boundary checking:
  - Maximum values: 4 CPU cores, 4096MB RAM, 2048MB disk, 300s timeout
  - Validates all limits are positive and within safe bounds
  
- **Tests added**: `tests/test_sandbox_limits.py`
  - 25 comprehensive tests covering all functionality
  - Tests for immutability, validation, trust levels, and edge cases
  - All tests passing
  
- **Updated sandbox_manager.py**:
  - SandboxConfig now uses ResourceLimits instead of individual parameters
  - Added backward compatibility properties (cpu_limit, memory_limit_mb, etc.)
  - Updated ProcessSandboxExecutor to use all limit fields
  - Updated DockerSandboxExecutor to use process and disk limits
  - Updated get_recommended_config() to use get_limits_for_trust_level()
  
- **Documentation**: Updated `docs/security/sandbox.md`
  - Added Resource Limits section with examples
  - Documented trust-based limits and custom configuration
  - Listed maximum allowed values for validation

## Status

### Working
- All three limit presets (DEFAULT, STRICT, RELAXED) properly configured
- Validation prevents excessive resource allocation
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing code
- Integration with sandbox_manager.py complete
- All tests passing (25/25)

### Known Limitations
- Resource limits are advisory for some strategies (e.g., restricted Python)
- Disk limits only enforced in Docker strategy via tmpfs size
- Process limits may not be enforced on all platforms

## Critical Notes

### Breaking Changes
- SandboxConfig constructor signature changed to accept ResourceLimits
- Old parameters (cpu_limit, memory_limit_mb) are now properties
- network_access property inverts network_offline for compatibility

### Performance
- No performance impact - limits are just configuration
- Validation adds negligible overhead (simple comparisons)

## Next Session

### Immediate Tasks
1. Issue #27 ([03] Add input validation to functions processing external data)
2. Issue #56 ([04] PH1-1: YAML configuration loader)
3. Issue #55 ([05] CI-DEBT-#4: type hygiene for store.py)

### Testing
- Consider adding integration tests with actual sandbox execution
- Test resource limit enforcement in real scenarios
- Verify Docker tmpfs actually respects disk_mb setting

## Files Changed
- Created: `luca_core/sandbox/limits.py`
- Created: `tests/test_sandbox_limits.py`
- Modified: `luca_core/sandbox/sandbox_manager.py`
- Modified: `luca_core/sandbox/__init__.py`
- Modified: `docs/security/sandbox.md`
- Modified: `docs/task_log.md`

### Test Coverage Improvements
- **Created comprehensive test suite** to achieve 98% coverage:
  - `tests/test_sandbox_config_limits.py` - Config integration tests
  - `tests/test_sandbox_coverage_boost.py` - Edge case tests
  - `tests/test_sandbox_final_coverage.py` - Docker and exception tests
  - `tests/test_sandbox_restricted_import.py` - Import restriction tests
  - `tests/test_sandbox_runner_coverage.py` - Runner timeout tests
  - `tests/test_subprocess_resource_limits.py` - Subprocess limit tests
  - `tests/test_final_core_coverage.py` - Registry and exception coverage

- **Coverage improvements**:
  - registry.py: 99% → 100% (duplicate registration test)
  - sandbox_manager.py: 86% → 88% (exception handling)
  - Overall core modules: 97% → 98%

## Current State

### Test Coverage
- Core modules (luca_core + essential tools): **98% coverage**
- All tests passing (411 total tests)
- Pre-commit hooks all passing
- Documentation updated

### Known Limitations
- Some lines in subprocess/thread contexts cannot be covered by pytest
- Abstract method `pass` statements don't need coverage
- Resource limit code executes in subprocess (covered but not tracked)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create PR for issue #60 with 98% test coverage
2. Move to issue #27 ([03] Add input validation to functions processing external data)
3. Continue with issue #56 ([04] PH1-1: YAML configuration loader)
4. Address issue #55 ([05] CI-DEBT-#4: type hygiene for store.py)

### Testing Recommendations
- Consider integration tests with actual Docker execution
- Verify resource limits are enforced in production scenarios
- Test with various trust levels in real usage
