# Handoff: 2025-06-08-6

## Session Summary
Resolved Issue #54 (CI-DEBT-#3: Fix legacy async tests) by re-enabling the test_mcp_integration.py tests that were previously ignored due to async compatibility issues. Fixed a failing test that was checking for absolute file paths.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Async Test Compatibility (Issue #54)
- Identified the root cause: test was using absolute path `/path/to/script.py` which triggered validation error
- Changed to relative path `./mcp_servers/test_script.py` in test configuration
- Added mock for `validate_file_path` function to bypass file existence check in tests
- Fixed the failing `test_connect_to_stdio_server` test

### 2. Re-enabled MCP Integration Tests
- Removed `--ignore=tests/test_mcp_integration.py` from `.config/pytest.ini`
- Verified all 27 tests pass (1 test skipped for full integration)
- Confirmed pytest-asyncio 0.24.0 is properly installed and working

## Current State
- **Working**: All async tests in test_mcp_integration.py are now running and passing
- **Broken**: None
- **Blocked**: None

## Next Steps
- Close Issue #54 as completed
- Next priorities in order:
  1. Issue #59: PH1-4: Improved logging and monitoring
  2. Issue #58: PH1-3: Basic authentication and session management
  3. Issue #57: PH1-2: Streamlit status panels

## Critical Notes
- The CI environment skip is still in place for MCP tests (when CI=true)
- One test requires RUN_MCP_INTEGRATION=1 environment variable for full integration testing
- All async fixtures are working properly with pytest-asyncio
