# Handoff: 2025-05-25-1

## Completed

### Coverage Tracking System (Issue #71)
- Created `tools/coverage_tracker.py` for tracking coverage trends
  - Tracks history in JSON format
  - Detects coverage regressions
  - Generates shields.io badges
  - Updates README.md automatically
- Modified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to track coverage in CI
- Updated `safety-check.sh` to track coverage locally
- Added coverage badge to README.md

### Security Scanning (Issue #73)
- Created `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated dependency updates
  - Daily checks for Python dependencies
  - Weekly checks for GitHub Actions
  - Auto-creates PRs for updates
- Created `.github/workflows/security.yml` for vulnerability scanning
  - Runs daily at 3 AM UTC
  - Uses Safety for dependency vulnerabilities
  - Uses Bandit for code security issues
  - Fails on critical/high severity issues
- Added `safety==3.5.1` to requirements-dev.txt

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/task_log_2025_05.md` with today's work
- Created this handoff document

## Status

### Working
- All pre-commit hooks passing (black, isort, flake8, bandit, mypy, markdownlint)
- Pre-push hook enforcing safety checks and documentation
- Coverage tracking with regression detection
- Security scanning workflows ready for deployment
- Coverage at 97.34% (above 95% requirement)

### Broken
- None identified

### Blocked
- Issue #72 was found to be already implemented, so we closed it

## Critical Notes

### Security Considerations
- Dependabot will create PRs automatically - review carefully before merging
- Security workflow will fail builds on critical vulnerabilities
- Coverage tracker has no authentication - suitable for public repos only

### Breaking Changes
- None

### Performance Impacts
- Pre-push hook now tracks coverage, adding ~1 second to push time
- Security scans in CI will add ~30 seconds to workflow time

## Next Session

### Priority Tasks
1. Merge this PR after review
2. Monitor first Dependabot PRs
3. Set up Claude Squad for tackling remaining issues
4. Consider adding coverage trends visualization
5. Add test coverage for remaining registry.py functions

### Required Reviews
- Verify security workflow runs correctly in GitHub Actions
- Check that Dependabot creates appropriate PRs
- Ensure coverage badge updates automatically
