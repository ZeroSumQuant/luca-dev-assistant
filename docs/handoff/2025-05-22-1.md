# LUCA Dev Assistant - Handoff Document
**Date**: 2025-05-22  
**Session**: 1  
**Branch**: fix/registry-determinism  
**Previous**: 2025-05-20-1.md  
**Focus**: Project completion assessment and issue cleanup

## Summary

Assessed LUCA project completion status and addressed several open GitHub issues to move the project closer to production readiness.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Project Assessment**:
   - Evaluated overall project completion at ~88%
   - Core functionality is complete and working
   - 305 tests passing with 99.27% coverage for core module
   - Identified remaining gaps: CI/CD, PyPI publishing, entry point test coverage

2. **Closed GitHub Issues**:
   - **Issue #67**: Verified safety-check.sh script exists with all required features
   - **Issue #64**: Archived KeyFindings/Todo.md file (all items already in GitHub issues)
   - **Issue #52**: Created docs/sandbox_limits.md with resource limit documentation

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Created KeyFindings/README.md explaining the archival process
   - Added comprehensive sandbox resource limits documentation
   - Documented default limits: CPU 1 core, MEM 1024 MB, DISK 512 MB, NET offline

## Files Modified

- `KeyFindings/Todo.md` â†’ `KeyFindings/archive/Todo-archived-2025-05-22.md` (archived)
- `KeyFindings/README.md` (created)
- `docs/sandbox_limits.md` (created)

## Current State

- All tests passing (305 total)
- Overall test coverage: 76.78% (needs improvement for luca.py and run_streamlit.py)
- Core module coverage: 99.27% (exceeds 95% requirement)
- 3 fewer open issues, bringing project closer to completion

## Next Steps

1. Create PR for all registry determinism fixes and issue closures
2. Focus on increasing test coverage for entry points (luca.py, run_streamlit.py)
3. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (Issue #72)
4. Work on PyPI packaging and distribution

## Technical Notes

- Registry determinism fixes from previous sessions are working well
- Test suite is stable with no flaky tests
- Documentation is being kept up to date with changes

## Handoff Items

- Ready to create PR for fix/registry-determinism branch
- Consider tackling CI/CD setup next for automated quality gates
- Entry point test coverage is the main blocker for 95% overall coverage
