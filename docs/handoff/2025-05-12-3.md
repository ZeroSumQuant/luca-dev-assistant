# 2025-05-12 Handoff #3 - Agent Orchestration Architecture

## Session Snapshot

Today's session focused on creating a comprehensive agent orchestration architecture document that provides a clear roadmap for implementing LUCA's core agent framework. This document addresses Issue #28 (Create agent orchestration architecture document) and lays the groundwork for implementing Issue #16 (Replace placeholder with actual AutoGen agent orchestration).

### Branch: `claude-2025-05-12-agent-orchestration`

The branch includes:
- Comprehensive agent orchestration architecture document (`docs/agent-orchestration.md`)
- Updated task log with documentation work
- This handoff document

## What We Completed

1. **Created Comprehensive Agent Orchestration Architecture**:
   - Defined the four core skeleton components:
     - ContextStore: Persistent shared memory across conversations and sessions
     - ToolRegistry: Central source of truth for all agent capabilities
     - Error-Payload Schema: Standardized approach to error handling
     - LucaManager: Thin coordination layer that connects all components
   - Documented a phased implementation approach with clear entry/exit criteria
   - Established agent hierarchy and communication patterns
   - Designed intelligent agent selection process with adaptation engine
   - Specified project management architecture with ticket export capability
   - Outlined sandbox architecture with security levels
   - Defined MCP integration architecture with domain-specific server activation

2. **Addressed Review Feedback**:
   - Added schema ownership clarification, specifying `luca_core/schemas/` as the home for all Pydantic models
   - Clarified that LucaManager uses per-task DockerSandbox until Phase 2 metrics prove a need for per-agent persistence
   - Added ticket export functionality to the Project model
   - Included complete MetricRecord model specification with all required fields
   - Made the document implementation-ready with sufficient detail for developers

3. **Updated Project Documentation**:
   - Added entry to task log documenting the architecture work
   - Created this handoff document summarizing the changes and next steps
   - Ensured all documentation meets project standards and conventions

## Open Issues

None! The architecture document has been completed and is ready for review and implementation. The document provides a clear roadmap for implementing Issue #16 (AutoGen agent orchestration).

## Next Recommended Steps

1. **Merge the Current PR**:
   - Review and merge this PR to add the agent orchestration architecture document to the main branch

2. **Begin Implementation of Core Primitives (Phase 0)**:
   - Create a new branch for implementing the four primitive components
   - Start with the ContextStore implementation (SQLite-backed with Pydantic serialization)
   - Implement the ToolRegistry with registration decorator
   - Create the Error-Payload Schema with standard categories and severity levels
   - Develop a minimal LucaManager with the core orchestration loop

3. **Create Integration Test**:
   - Develop a "Hello World" integration test that uses all four primitives
   - Ensure the test passes in CI with proper timeouts and resource management

## Ready-Up Checklist

- [x] Comprehensive agent orchestration architecture document created
- [x] All review feedback addressed in the document
- [x] Task log updated with architecture documentation work
- [x] Handoff document created with clear next steps
- [x] Document provides sufficient detail for implementation

## Additional Notes

The architecture document was designed to provide a clear path to implementation while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements. The phased approach ensures that each layer is thoroughly tested before moving to the next, reducing risk and ensuring a stable product.

A key decision was to start with per-task DockerSandbox instances for all operations in Phase 0, deferring potential optimizations for per-agent persistence until Phase 2 when metrics can justify the added complexity. This approach prioritizes security and isolation while maintaining simplicity in the initial implementation.

The document establishes a solid foundation for the core agent orchestration system and addresses Issue #28 completely, setting the stage for implementing Issue #16 (the actual agent orchestration).
