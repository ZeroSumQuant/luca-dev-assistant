## Session Summary

Fixed autogen dependency conflicts that were causing dependabot PR failures and cleaned up repository for professional presentation.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed autogen dependency conflict (requirements.txt)
- Updated both autogen-agentchat and autogen-ext to 0.6.1
- Resolved dependency lock issue where packages must share same autogen-core version
- This fixes failing dependabot PRs #125 and #126

### 2. Cleaned up repository presentation
- Removed all .DS_Store files from repository
- Removed temporary artifacts (zip file, coverage_history.json)
- Repository is now clean for recruiter review

## Current State

- **Working**: All core functionality, CI/CD pipeline, 97% test coverage
- **Fixed**: Autogen dependency conflicts resolved
- **Pending**: Two dependabot PRs can now be closed in favor of our fix
- **Branch**: fix/autogen-version-sync ready for PR

## Next Steps

1. Create PR for fix/autogen-version-sync branch
2. Close dependabot PRs #125 and #126 in favor of our combined fix
3. Monitor for any new dependabot updates
4. Continue CAKE integration planning

## Critical Notes

- Autogen packages must always be updated together due to shared core dependency
- Pre-push hooks enforce strict documentation schema validation
- Repository is presentation-ready for recruiting purposes
