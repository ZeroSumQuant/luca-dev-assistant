## Session Summary

Enhanced issue dependency validation to parse dependencies from planning documents, ensuring issues are worked on in the correct order to prevent merge conflicts.

## Work Completed

### 1. Enhanced Validation Script
- Modified `scripts/dev-tools/validate-issue-order.py` to parse planning document
- Added `parse_planning_doc_dependencies()` function to extract dependencies from:
  - "Blocks: #60, #50, #120" patterns
  - "Depends on: #26" patterns
- Script now merges dependencies from both GitHub and planning documents
- Found 7 issues with dependencies in planning doc but not in GitHub

### 2. Created Sync Script
- Added `scripts/dev-tools/sync-issue-dependencies.py` to sync dependencies to GitHub
- Supports two modes:
  - Update issue body with "Blocked by: #123" text (default)
  - Add "blocked-by:#123" labels (with --use-labels flag)
- Includes dry-run mode for safe testing
- Successfully tested parsing all dependencies

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated validation script docstring to explain all dependency sources
- Updated task log with work completed (in reverse chronological order)

## Current State

- **Working**: Both scripts function correctly
- **Branch**: fix/issue-dependency-tracking
- **Ready for**: Running safety checks and committing

## Critical Notes

- Dependencies exist in planning document but NOT in GitHub issues
- This mismatch could lead to working on blocked issues
- Sync script can fix this by updating GitHub issues
- Validation script now catches dependencies from both sources

## Next Steps

1. Run safety checks and commit these changes
2. Consider running sync script to update GitHub issues
3. Add validation to CI pipeline to prevent future mismatches
4. Update team workflow to maintain dependencies in GitHub
