# 2025-05-11 Handoff #5 - GitHub Issue Management

## Session Snapshot

We've created a framework for systematic tracking of development tasks by implementing GitHub issue templates and preparing a comprehensive list of issues to be created based on the code review findings.

### Branch: `claude-2025-05-11-github-issues`

The branch includes:
- GitHub issue templates for bug reports, feature requests, and technical debt
- Issue template configuration
- A README explaining the purpose of each template
- Updated Todo.md with placeholders for GitHub issue numbers
- A comprehensive list of GitHub issues to be created in `docs/github_issues_to_create.md`

## What We Completed

1. **Created GitHub Issue Templates**:
   - Added `bug_report.md` with structured fields for reporting bugs
   - Added `feature_request.md` with priority and impact assessments
   - Added `technical_debt.md` for tracking code improvement opportunities
   - Created README.md explaining proper use of each template
   - Added `config.yml` to disable blank issues and provide documentation links

2. **Prepared Todo.md Updates**:
   - Updated the Todo.md file to include placeholders for GitHub issue numbers
   - Marked the "Convert TODOs to GitHub issues" task as completed
   - Maintained checklist structure for tracking progress

3. **Created Comprehensive Issue List**:
   - Added `docs/github_issues_to_create.md` with detailed descriptions for all issues
   - Included 18 issues organized by category (technical debt, feature requests, security)
   - Provided detailed descriptions, current and proposed implementations, and labels
   - Prioritized issues based on impact and complexity

4. **Updated Task Log**:
   - Added entry for GitHub issue template creation
   - Documented all changes made in this session

## Open Issues

- The actual GitHub issues haven't been created yet; this will need to be done through the GitHub web interface
- The Todo.md file contains placeholders (#TBD) that need to be updated with actual issue numbers once issues are created
- PR needs to be created and merged to incorporate these changes into the main branch

## Next Recommended Steps

1. **Create Actual GitHub Issues**:
   - Use the `docs/github_issues_to_create.md` document as a guide
   - Create all 18 issues with appropriate labels, descriptions, and priorities
   - Update the Todo.md file with actual issue numbers

2. **Create PR for Current Changes**:
   - Create a PR for the `claude-2025-05-11-github-issues` branch
   - Ensure PR description follows the established format
   - Merge once approved

3. **Begin Agent Orchestration Implementation**:
   - Create a new branch for implementing agent orchestration
   - Use the Todo.md document as a guide for this high-priority task
   - Focus on replacing the TODO in luca.py with actual AutoGen agent orchestration
