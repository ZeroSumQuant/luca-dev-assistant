# Documentation Consistency Audit Report to o3 CTO

## Summary

Completed initial documentation consistency audit and configuration setup.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created umbrella ticket**: [PH1-DOC: naming-consistency & task-log audit (#65)](https://github.com/ZeroSumQuant/luca-dev-assistant/issues/65)

2. **Naming scan results**: All references in docs use proper conventions (snake_case for files, PascalCase for classes)

3. **Task log audit**:
   - Found continuous date sequence from 2025-05-03 to 2025-05-16
   - No duplicates detected
   - Gap in dates: 2025-05-09 and 2025-05-10 missing

4. **Markdown linting setup**:
   - Installed markdownlint-cli via homebrew
   - Created `.markdownlint.json` with reasonable defaults (disabled line-length rule)
   - Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to include markdown linting
   - Hit Ruby version issue with original markdownlint, switched to markdownlint-cli
   - Fixed pre-commit config (removed unsupported timeout key from bandit, added types field to markdownlint)

## Findings

### Markdown Violations (Major patterns):

- Line length violations (MD013) - disabled in config as not critical
- Missing blank lines around lists (MD032)
- Missing language specifications in code blocks (MD040)
- Trailing spaces (MD009)
- Emphasis used instead of headings (MD036)

## Pre-commit Results

- All Python linters pass (black, isort, flake8, bandit, mypy)
- Markdownlint found violations in multiple files (now properly configured)

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Run markdownlint --fix on all docs to auto-fix violations
2. Review and update task logs for missing dates (2025-05-09, 2025-05-10)
3. ✅ Commit the configuration changes (completed - need to resolve merge conflict)
4. Create CI integration for markdown linting

## Technical Notes

- Ruby 2.6.10 too old for original markdownlint gem
- Using markdownlint-cli (Node-based) instead
- Custom `.markdownlint.json` created to be less strict about formatting
- Pre-commit hooks successfully configured and tested
