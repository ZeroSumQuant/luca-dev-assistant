# Handoff Document - 2025-06-08 (#2)

## Session Summary

Optimized test suite performance achieving 6.5x speedup (36s → 5.6s) through targeted optimizations and parallel execution.

## Work Completed

### 1. Test Optimizations
- **SQLite Backup Tests** (`tests/luca_core_pkgtests/test_sqlite_store.py`)
  - Replaced `asyncio.sleep(1.5)` with direct backup method calls
  - Changed backup interval from 1s to 3600s in test fixture
  - Saved 3 seconds total

### 2. Sandbox Timeout Test
- **File**: `tests/test_sandbox_manager.py`
- Reduced timeout from 1s to 0.1s for timeout validation
- Test still validates timeout behavior correctly
- Saved 0.9 seconds

### 3. Parallel Test Execution
- Added pytest-xdist==3.5.0 to requirements-dev.txt
- Created `make test-fast` target for parallel tests
- Updated safety-check.sh to auto-detect and use parallel testing
- Achieved 557% CPU utilization (multi-core)

### 4. Documentation
- Created comprehensive research document: `docs/research/test-suite-optimization.md`
- Updated Makefile help text to include test-fast target
- Fixed import issues caught by linting

## Performance Results

```
Sequential: 36 seconds → 33 seconds (with optimizations)
Parallel:   36 seconds → 5.6 seconds (6.5x speedup)
Pre-push:   90+ seconds → ~20 seconds
```

## Current State

- Branch: `feature/test-optimization` (ready for PR)
- Tests: All passing with 96.11% coverage
- Performance: Tests run in 5.6s (parallel) vs 36s (sequential)
- Pre-push hooks: Now complete in ~20s (was 90+s)
- CI: Expected to see significant improvement
- Code Quality: All linting, formatting, and security checks pass

## Technical Details

- Used pytest-xdist 3.5.0 (not 3.6.0 which has pytest-cov compatibility issues)
- Coverage collection works seamlessly with parallel execution
- All tests pass with maintained coverage (96%)

## Next Steps

1. Monitor CI performance with these optimizations
2. Consider additional optimizations:
   - Mock subprocess calls in watchdog tests
   - Use in-memory SQLite for test databases
   - Implement test result caching

## Environment
- Branch: `feature/test-optimization`
- Python: 3.13.3
- Working directory: `/Users/dustinkirby/Documents/GitHub/luca-dev-assistant`

## Notes
- Pre-commit hooks now complete in reasonable time
- Developer experience significantly improved
- No functionality changes, only test performance improvements
