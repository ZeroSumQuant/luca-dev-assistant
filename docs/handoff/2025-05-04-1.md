# Luca Dev Assistant · Handoff 2025-05-04

## 1 · Snapshot — What We Achieved Today

| File / Resource | Status & Notes |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `.github/workflows/update-changelog.yml` | **Created & hardened** – added `permissions: contents write`, pinned Node 20, diff-guard, merged-only trigger. |
| `docs/handoff/changelog.md` | **Auto-generated** – workflow now appends Conventional-Commit entries on every merged PR. |
| `docs/task_log.md` | **Added** – single-source running ledger for all future tasks. |
| `ci/changelog-perms` PR | Merged cleanly; workflow run finished green ✔. |
| Local Node setup | Installed via **nvm** (`20.19.1`), global `conventional-changelog-cli` installed for dry-runs. |

## 2 · CI / Automation Upgrades

* **Update Changelog** workflow now:
  * Installs changelog CLI, regenerates file, commits only if diff ≠ 0.
  * Possesses write perms (`contents: write`) so the bot can push.
  * Runs **only** on merged PRs into `main`; avoids loops with `[skip ci]`.
* Verified with a test PR (`docs/test-pr-changelog`) → bot commit `chore: update changelog [skip ci]` landed on `main`.

## 3 · Local Environment

* `nvm`, Node 20, and `conventional-changelog-cli` configured globally.
* Repo synced: `main` at commit `6d8a987`; all local branches rebased & pushed.

## 4 · Open Branches

| Branch | Purpose | Next Action |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `ci/changelog-perms` | **Merged** – can delete safely. | `git branch -d` local / delete remote when convenient. |
| `feature/luca-core` | **Not yet created** – will hold initial AutoGen skeleton. | Create after next session. |

## 5 · Next Recommended Steps

1. **Cut `feature/luca-core`**  
   `git checkout -b feature/luca-core`
2. Scaffold `luca.py` with AutoGen `FileTool` + Docker executor (Phase 1 of build plan).
3. Add minimal unit test (`tests/test_luca_smoke.py`) to invoke the CLI and assert exit 0.
4. Extend CI to run `pytest -q` and build Docker image on every PR.
