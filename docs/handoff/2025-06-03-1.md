## Session Summary

Completed final repository cleanup by fixing import paths after major file reorganization. All files that imported from `luca.py` were updated for the new `scripts/` location. Repository is now professionally organized, lint-free, and ready for Superwise AI recruiter presentation.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed import paths after major reorganization
Updated all files that import from `luca.py` after it was moved to `scripts/` directory:
- `scripts/luca.py`: Added parent directory to sys.path with `noqa: E402` comments
- `app/main.py`: Updated import path to find luca.py in scripts directory  
- `tests/test_registry_specific_coverage.py`: Added scripts to sys.path for luca imports
- `tests/test_luca_echo.py`: Updated subprocess call to use `scripts/luca.py`
- `tests/test_luca_smoke.py`: Updated subprocess call to use `scripts/luca.py`
- `scripts/run_streamlit.py`: Fixed path to app directory (now uses `../app/main_modern.py`)
- `scripts/dev-tools/safety-check.sh`: Updated to use `.config/.coveragerc` instead of `.coveragerc`

### 2. Code quality fixes
Resolved all linting violations:
- Added `noqa: E402` comments for imports after sys.path modifications
- Fixed long lines in test files to meet 88-character limit
- All files now pass black, isort, and flake8 checks

### 3. Database path fix
Updated DB_PATH in luca.py to use correct relative path from scripts directory

## Current State

- **Working**: All tests pass with 97.29% coverage (exceeds 95% requirement)
- **Working**: All linting tools pass (black, isort, flake8, bandit, mypy)
- **Working**: Repository is professionally organized with clean root directory
- **Ready**: Repository prepared for Superwise AI recruiter presentation

## Critical Notes

- **Import Strategy**: Files in scripts/ directory now add parent directory to sys.path to access luca_core modules
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained high coverage despite major file reorganization
- **Safety Checks**: All pre-commit and pre-push hooks working correctly with new structure
- **No Breaking Changes**: All functionality preserved during reorganization

## Next Steps

- **Priority**: Push final cleanup branch and create PR for merge
- **Follow-up**: Create PR for repository cleanup completion
- **Documentation**: No additional documentation needed - all changes documented in task log and this handoff
- **Testing**: Consider running full integration test suite before merging to main
