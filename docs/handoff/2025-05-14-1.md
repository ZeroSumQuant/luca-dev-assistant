# Handoff Report - 2025-05-14

## Summary

Implemented HTTP connection support in the MCP Client Manager as specified in issue #17. This enhancement allows the client manager to connect to remote MCP servers using HTTP, enabling more flexible deployment scenarios.

## Tasks Completed

1. Created branch `claude-2025-05-14-http-mcp-connection` for HTTP connection implementation
2. Added HTTP client connection functionality with robust error handling:
   - Imported the `streamablehttp_client` from the MCP client library
   - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff for connection failures
   - Added proper connection timeout handling
   - Enhanced error logging for HTTP-specific issues
3. Added configurable parameters to the `MCPServerConfig` class:
   - `timeout_seconds` - Connection timeout in seconds (default: 30)
   - `max_retries` - Maximum connection retry attempts (default: 3)
   - `retry_delay_seconds` - Initial delay between retries with exponential backoff (default: 1)
4. Updated `example_usage()` to demonstrate connecting to both stdio and HTTP servers
5. Enhanced `initialize_default_servers()` to document future configuration loading capabilities
6. Ensured code passes all linting checks and tests

## Implementation Details

The implementation allows for robust HTTP connections with:

- Explicit timeout configuration
- Exponential backoff retry logic for transient network failures
- Detailed error reporting for each connection attempt
- Clean exception handling and appropriate logging

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push changes to the repository
2. Create a pull request to close issue #17
3. Consider implementing issue #18 (MCP server configuration loading from config file) as a logical next step, which would build on this implementation
