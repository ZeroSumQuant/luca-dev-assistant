# 2025-05-12 Handoff #2 - GitHub CLI Documentation

## Session Snapshot

We've added comprehensive GitHub CLI documentation to the developer guide to ensure future developers can effectively use this tool for project management tasks. This information wasn't included in the previous PR that was already merged, so we created a separate branch for this documentation addition.

### Branch: `claude-2025-05-12-github-cli-docs`

The branch includes:

- Added GitHub CLI usage section to the developer guide
- Updated docs/task_log.md with our work

## What We Completed

1. **Added GitHub CLI Documentation to Developer Guide**:
   - Created a new section in docs/luca_dev_guide.md on GitHub CLI usage
   - Documented installation and authentication procedures
   - Added comprehensive instructions for managing issues
   - Included commands for working with labels
   - Provided examples for PR creation and management
   - Added repository operation commands
   - Included references to official documentation

2. **Updated Task Log**:
   - Added an entry for the GitHub CLI documentation work
   - Ensured the project history is complete and up-to-date

## Open Issues

None! The GitHub CLI documentation has been successfully added to the developer guide and is ready to be merged.

## Next Recommended Steps

1. **Merge the Current PR**:
   - Review and merge this PR to add the GitHub CLI documentation to the main branch

2. **Start Working on Agent Orchestration Architecture**:
   - Create a new branch for implementing agent orchestration architecture document (Issue #28)
   - This is a prerequisite for implementing the actual agent orchestration (Issue #16)
   - Focus on designing the architecture before implementation

3. **Prioritize Core Functionality Issues**:
   - After documenting the architecture, focus on implementing the agent orchestration (Issue #16)
   - Then implement the agent call mechanism in the UI (Issue #19)
   - These are the most critical issues for MVP completion
