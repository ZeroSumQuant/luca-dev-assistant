# Luca Dev Assistant Handoff (May 7, 2025)

## Session Snapshot

The Luca Dev Assistant is close to MVP status (approximately 80-85% complete). The main blocker is resolving CI pipeline issues with hanging tests. Once these issues are fixed, we should be able to complete the remaining steps to MVP.

## Current Project Status

- **Repository Location**: `/Users/dustinkirby/dev/luca-dev-assistant/`
- **Current Branch**: `claude-2025-05-06-fix-linting`
- **Latest Commit**: `8f50042e19` - "fix(tests): resolve hanging tests and import order issues"

## Key Issues Identified & Fixes Applied

### 1. Import Order Issue
- **Problem**: `FunctionTool` was imported before the module docstring in `luca.py`
- **Fix Applied**: Moved the import after the docstring to follow Python conventions
- **File Modified**: `luca.py`

### 2. Hanging Test Problem
- **Problem**: `test_luca_echo.py` was hanging indefinitely because:
  - It launches a subprocess to run `luca.py`
  - The script attempts to launch the Streamlit UI
  - This causes the test to hang indefinitely without a timeout
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Added testing mode environment variable (`LUCA_TESTING`)
  - Modified `luca.py` to check for this environment variable and skip UI launch when present
  - Added timeout to subprocess call as fallback safety measure
  - Added explicit assertions to verify UI isn't launched
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `tests/test_luca_echo.py`
  - `luca.py`

### 3. CI Pipeline Still Hanging
- **Problem**: Despite fixing `test_luca_echo.py`, the CI pipeline still hangs during `pytest -q`
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Appears to be AutoGen-related issues with other tests, particularly `test_luca_smoke.py`
- **Fix Status**: Partial fix implemented, but CI still hanging

## Immediate Next Steps (Detailed Plan)

### 1. Implement Proper Timeouts
- **Actions**:
  - Add `pytest-timeout` to requirements.txt
  - Configure with both timeout value and thread method
  - This will force tests to terminate after a threshold, preventing CI hangs
  
```yaml
# In CI workflow
- name: Run tests with timeout
  run: |
    python -m pytest --timeout=60 --timeout_method=thread
```

### 2. Create Test Isolation Strategy
- **Actions**:
  - Add `conftest.py` with environment variable setup
  - Configure AutoGen to use mock responses in CI
  - Isolate tests to prevent cross-contamination
  
```python
# In tests/conftest.py
import os
import pytest

def pytest_configure(config):
    """Set up environment for CI testing."""
    if os.environ.get("CI") == "true":
        os.environ["LUCA_TESTING"] = "1"
        # Disable any external API calls
        os.environ["AUTOGEN_USE_MOCK_RESPONSE"] = "1"
```

### 3. Refactor Remaining Problematic Tests
- **Actions**:
  - Apply environment-based skipping to `test_luca_smoke.py` and other hanging tests
  - Add explicit timeouts to all AutoGen agent tests
  - Ensure proper termination of all agent conversations
  
```python
@pytest.mark.skipif(
    os.environ.get("CI") == "true" and "FORCE_SMOKE_TESTS" not in os.environ,
    reason="Smoke tests skipped in CI by default - use FORCE_SMOKE_TESTS=1 to enable"
)
def test_smoke_example():
    # Test implementation...
```

### 4. Update GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Actions**:
  - Add memory monitoring
  - Increase visibility into test execution
  - Configure global timeout
  
```yaml
name: CI Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15  # Global timeout
    steps:
      # Checkout, setup steps...
      - name: Run tests with resource monitoring
        run: |
          python -c "import psutil; print(f'Available memory: {psutil.virtual_memory().available / (1024**3):.2f} GB')"
          python -m pytest --timeout=60 --timeout_method=thread -v
```

### 5. Fix AutoGen-Specific Integration
- **Actions**:
  - Add explicit termination conditions to all AutoGen agents
  - Set multiprocessing start method to "spawn"
  - Implement timeouts for all external API calls
  
```python
def configure_test_agent():
    """Configure AutoGen agent for testing."""
    assistant = AssistantAgent(
        "assistant",
        llm_config={"timeout": 10},  # API timeout
        is_termination_msg=lambda msg: "TERMINATE" in msg
    )
    
    # Force correct process start method
    import multiprocessing as mp
    mp.set_start_method("spawn", force=True)
    
    return assistant
```

## Root Cause Analysis of CI Issues

Based on extensive research, the CI hanging issues are likely caused by:

1. **Resource Constraints**: CI environments have stricter resource limits, causing silent termination when exceeded
2. **Environment Differences**: Filesystem access, network configuration differences between local and CI
3. **Docker Integration**: Container limitations in CI environment
4. **AutoGen Concurrency**: Agent-based architecture has complex termination conditions that may deadlock

Testing evidence revealed that AutoGen's agent orchestration can be problematic in CI environments due to:
- LLM API timeout issues creating silent hangs
- Lack of proper termination conditions in agent conversations
- Resource-intensive nature of running multiple agents simultaneously

## Future Vision & Extensions

Post-MVP, we plan to explore:

1. **Enhanced IDE Integration**:
   - Embed Monaco Editor for code editing
   - Create a secure virtual terminal for command execution
   - Provide a seamless development experience

2. **Security Architecture**:
   - Implement isolated workspace model
   - Use container-based execution for all code
   - Create a zero-trust permission model that's transparent to users

3. **Native App Packaging**:
   - Package as a Mac .dmg application
   - Integrate with macOS security features
   - Provide a native-feeling experience

## Task Completion Status

✅ Fixed import order in `luca.py`
✅ Implemented testing mode via environment variable
✅ Added timeout to subprocess call in tests
✅ Updated task log with changes
✅ Successfully committed and pushed changes to branch

❌ CI pipeline still hangs (requires further fixes detailed above)
❌ Additional tests may still hang even with current fixes

## Ready-Up Checklist

- [ ] Implement pytest-timeout with thread method
- [ ] Create conftest.py for test environment configuration
- [ ] Fix test_luca_smoke.py hanging issues
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflow for better diagnostics
- [ ] Run full test suite with improved timeouts
- [ ] Update task log with final fixes

## Next Developer Focus

When resuming this project, focus on implementing the test isolation strategy and timeout configuration to get the CI passing. The most critical first step is adding pytest-timeout with the thread method to gain visibility into hanging tests.
