# Handoff Document - 2025-05-26

## Session Summary

Created issue-checker.sh script to help identify open GitHub issues that may already be implemented. The script successfully found 9 issues that appear to be completed. Also comprehensively updated CLAUDE.md to document all helper scripts and integrate them into the mandatory workflow, making it easier for Claude instances to follow best practices and avoid common mistakes.

## Work Completed

### 1. Created issue-checker.sh Script
- Automated script to scan codebase for implemented features
- Maps open issues to potential implementations
- Found 9 issues that may be ready to close:
  - #96: JSON Schema validation (schemas/ and validate_documentation.py exist)
  - #95: Code watchdog (code_watchdog.py exists)
  - #61: MCP AutoGen bridge (mcp_autogen_bridge.py exists)
  - #60: Sandbox limits (documentation exists)
  - #57: Streamlit status panels (UI implementation exists)
  - #56: YAML config loader (YAML loading code exists)
  - #49: LucaManager CLI (LucaManager class exists)
  - #28: Agent orchestration doc (agent-orchestration.md exists)
  - #24: AutoGen tests (agent tests exist)

### 2. Updated CLAUDE.md
- Added new "Helper Scripts for Claude" section
- Documented all three helper scripts with usage instructions
- Integrated claude-startup.sh into mandatory session start
- Added branch-check.sh step before creating new branches
- Clear guidance on when to use each script

## Key Decisions

- Helper scripts should be prominently documented in CLAUDE.md
- claude-startup.sh should be part of the mandatory workflow
- branch-check.sh should be run before creating new branches
- Clear, actionable instructions help Claude instances work effectively

## Current State

- issue-checker.sh created and tested successfully
- CLAUDE.md comprehensively updated with all helper scripts
- All scripts are executable and working
- Documentation updated
- Ready to identify and close completed issues

## Next Steps

1. Review the 9 potentially completed issues in detail
2. Verify each implementation matches issue requirements
3. Close completed issues with appropriate comments
4. Create PR for issue-checker script and CLAUDE.md updates

## Issues/Concerns

- Some issues may be partially implemented - need manual verification
- Script only checks for obvious implementations, subtle completions may be missed

## For Next Session

- Use issue-checker.sh to systematically review and close completed issues
- Consider enhancing the script to check more issue types
- Monitor how Claude Squad uses the updated workflow with all helper scripts
