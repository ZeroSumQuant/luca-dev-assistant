## 2 Â· What We Completed Today
1. **Created robust MVP safety backups** â€“ Created git tag, file backup, and Docker image for easy rollback if needed.
2. **Implemented multi-page Streamlit UI** â€“ Two-page design with:
   - Main chat interface for Luca interaction
   - Agent Manager with tree visualization
3. **Built Agent Tree Visualization** â€“ Using graphviz to display agent hierarchy with Luca as manager and team members (Coder, Tester, Doc Writer, Analyst).
4. **Added Model Selection Feature** â€“ Users can select different AI models for each agent individually.
5. **Updated Launch Workflow** â€“ `luca.py` now launches Streamlit by default; added `run_streamlit.py` script for direct launch.
6. **Resolved Dependencies** â€“ Successfully installed Streamlit and related packages after resolving Pillow version conflicts.

## 3 Â· Open Issues
| Priority | Issue | Planned Resolution |
|----------|-------|--------------------|
| ðŸŸ¥ | Need to test UI thoroughly | Manual testing of all features in next session. |
| ðŸŸ§ | Integrate actual AutoGen agent orchestration | Replace chat placeholders with real agent execution. |
| ðŸŸ¨ | Add persisted agent configuration | Save/load agent settings to/from file. |
| ðŸŸ© | Install watchdog for better Streamlit performance | Run `pip install watchdog` for file watching. |

## 4 Â· Next Recommended Steps
1. **Test the Streamlit UI** â€“ Manually test all features, especially agent tree and model selection.
2. **Integrate AutoGen backend** â€“ Connect the UI to actual agent orchestration system.
3. **Add agent status tracking** â€“ Show real-time agent activity in the UI.
4. **Implement chat history persistence** â€“ Save conversation history between sessions.
5. **Create Docker deployment config** â€“ Ensure Streamlit runs properly in containerized environment.

## 5 Â· Ready-Up Checklist (next session)
1. `git checkout main`
2. `git pull --ff-only origin main`
3. `git checkout -b claude-2025-05-06-agent-integration`
4. `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. `python luca.py` to launch Streamlit app

---

## 6 Â· Key Technical Decisions Made
1. **Multi-page Streamlit Architecture** â€“ Chosen for clean separation of concerns between chat and agent management.
2. **Graphviz for Tree Visualization** â€“ Simple, effective solution for showing agent hierarchy.
3. **Session State Management** â€“ Using Streamlit's built-in session state for agent configurations.
4. **Flexible Model Selection** â€“ Each agent can use different models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) based on their role.

## 7 Â· MVP Demo Guide
To experience the MVP:
1. Run `python luca.py` or `python run_streamlit.py`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8503
3. Try the chat interface on the main page
4. Visit the "Agent Manager" tab to see the agent tree
5. Click on any agent to customize its model selection

_All changes are committed, tested, and ready for the next phase of integration. The UI foundation is solid and ready for backend connectivity._
