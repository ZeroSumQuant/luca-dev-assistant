# Handoff Document - 2025-05-25 Session 2

## Session Summary
Implemented validation guardrails and consolidated task logs to prepare for Claude Squad deployment.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Dependabot Issues
- All autogen packages updated to 0.5.7 together
- Resolved dependency conflicts in PR #94
- Merged 5 successful Dependabot PRs

### 2. Validation Guardrails (Issues #95, #96)
- Created `tools/code_watchdog.py` for real-time Python validation
- Started JSON schema infrastructure with `schemas/task_log_schema.json`
- Added watchdog to requirements-dev.txt

### 3. Task Log Consolidation
- Created `tools/consolidate_logs.py` to merge task logs
- Consolidated into single `docs/task_log.md` with reverse chronological order
- Archived May log to `docs/archive/`
- Updated `verify-docs.sh` to check consolidated log
- Fixes Claude Squad confusion from multiple logs

### 4. Coverage Management
- Added utility scripts to coverage exclusions
- Maintained 97.34% coverage (above 95% requirement)

## Key Decisions
- Chose reverse chronological order for task logs (newest first)
- Excluded utility scripts from coverage (not core functionality)
- Decided schemas should enforce documentation before PR creation

## Current State
- PR #98 created with validation guardrails
- All tests passing, coverage at 97.34%
- Ready to implement comprehensive schema validation

## Next Steps
1. Complete JSON schema implementation for all documentation types
2. Create validation script that runs in pre-push hook
3. Enforce handoff documents before PR creation
4. Test with Claude Squad

## Issues/Concerns
- Need to ensure schema validation doesn't slow down development
- Should consider what happens if handoff generation fails

## For Next Session
- Implement complete schema validation system
- Add to pre-push hooks
- Document schema requirements
