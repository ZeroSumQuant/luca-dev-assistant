# Handoff 2025-05-14-2: Completed MCP Integration Tests

## Summary
Addressed issue #25 by implementing comprehensive tests for the MCP integration components. Focus was on thoroughly testing the MCPClientManager and MCPAutogenBridge classes with proper async test handling and comprehensive error case coverage.

## Work Completed
- Added 21 test cases covering all major functionality of the MCP client and bridge
- Created helper functions for mocking MCP protocol objects with valid structure
- Fixed async test handling using proper pytest-asyncio fixtures
- Fixed error case tests with consistent error handling approach
- Improved test coverage to 77% for MCP components
- Added conditional integration test that can be enabled with RUN_MCP_INTEGRATION=1

## Key Findings
- MCP protocol objects (CallToolRequest, ListToolsRequest) require specific fields for Pydantic validation
- The connect_to_server method returns False instead of raising exceptions when connections fail
- Async mocks need special handling to work correctly in test fixtures
- The test coverage is good but could be further improved for edge cases

## Next Steps
- Create a PR linking to issue #25
- Further improve test coverage for MCP client and bridge
- Consider implementing benchmarks for MCP performance

## Questions
- Should connect_to_server be modified to propagate exceptions instead of catching them?
- Is there a standard approach for mocking MCP protocol objects that should be followed?
- Would integration tests with real server endpoints be valuable to add to the CI pipeline?
