## Summary
Updated CLAUDE.md with stricter safety protocols and created automation infrastructure issues for life-critical system development.

## Completed
- Updated CLAUDE.md with 95% coverage requirement (previously 85%)
- Created 8 GitHub issues for automation safeguards (#67-#74)
- Fixed linting issues in convert_issues.py
- Ran quality gates and exposed critical coverage gap

## Changes Made
- CLAUDE.md: Comprehensive update with safety protocols
- convert_issues.py: Fixed flake8 warning (ambiguous variable name)
- docs/task_log.md: Added entry for today's work
- Created automation_issues.md: Summary of issues created

## Current Status
- Working: Basic functionality, linting, formatting
- Broken: Test coverage at 61% (required: 95%)
- Blocked: Cannot push until coverage increases

## Critical Notes
- **MAJOR ISSUE**: Current test coverage is only 61%, well below our 95% requirement
- We're not practicing what we preach - need to increase coverage urgently
- Pre-commit hooks are working but need enhancement for coverage checks

## Next Session TODO
1. Implement safety-check.sh script (#67)
2. Create pre-push git hook (#68)
3. **URGENT**: Increase test coverage from 61% to 95%
4. Add pytest-cov to requirements-dev.txt

## Lessons Learned
- Always run quality gates before setting standards
- Coverage requirements must be realistic and achievable
- Automation is critical to prevent human error (like ours today)
