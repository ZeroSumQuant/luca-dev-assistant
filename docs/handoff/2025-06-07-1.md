## Session Summary

Analyzed CAKE (Claude Autonomy Kit Engine) project for integration into LUCA and reviewed all 29 open GitHub issues to create a proper development sequence.

## Work Completed

### 1. CAKE Analysis
- Reviewed CAKE project structure from `/Users/dustinkirby/Desktop/CAKE-latest.zip`
- Identified key components: CakeController, Operator, RecallDB, PTYShim, Validator, Watchdog
- Analyzed `CAKEAdapter` class for integration pattern
- Determined CAKE acts as intelligent wrapper around LLM agents

### 2. Integration Planning
- Created comprehensive integration analysis report
- Identified integration architecture: User → LUCA UI → LucaManager → CAKE Wrapper → Agent → Tools
- Found no conflicts with existing LUCA architecture
- Discovered CAKE directly solves issue #120 (time-traveling interrupt system)

### 3. Issue Dependency Analysis
- Reviewed all 29 open GitHub issues
- Created chronological dependency order based on blocking relationships
- Grouped issues into 9 phases for proper sequencing
- Identified critical path: Sandboxing → Config → Service Layer → CAKE Integration

### 4. Documentation
- Created `/Users/dustinkirby/Desktop/DEV-DOCS/LUCA-CAKE-Integration-Analysis-2025-06-07.md`
- Created `/Users/dustinkirby/Desktop/DEV-DOCS/LUCA-Issues-Chronological-Order-2025-06-07.md`
- Added `docs/development/issue-dependency-order-2025-06-07.md` to repository
- Updated `docs/task_log.md`

## Current State

- **Working**: Documentation complete, clear development path established
- **Branch**: Created new `docs/cake-integration-planning` branch
- **Ready for**: Commit and PR creation

## Critical Notes

- CAKE integration requires sandboxing (#26) to be completed first
- Issue #120 (interrupt system) is directly solved by CAKE integration
- UI redesign issues (#107-110) provide opportunity for CAKE monitoring displays
- No architectural conflicts found - CAKE enhances rather than replaces

## Next Steps

1. Commit and create PR for documentation branch
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation starting with issue #26 (sandboxing)
3. Follow the chronological order document for proper sequencing
4. Integrate CAKE in Phase 4 after infrastructure is ready

## Additional Work Completed

### 5. Issue Validation System
- Created `scripts/dev-tools/validate-issue-order.py` per CTO requirements
- Implemented dependency extraction from labels and issue bodies
- Added proper exit codes (0=OK, 1=warnings, 2=errors)
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_validate_issue_order.py`
- Added `.github/workflows/quality.yml` for CI integration
- Added ruff to requirements-dev.txt

## For Development Tonight

Recommended order based on dependencies:
1. **#26** - Sandboxing strategy (unblocks everything)
2. **#56** - YAML config loader (needed by many features)  
3. **#82** - Fix UI test errors (blocks UI work)
4. **#30** - Service layer (clean CAKE integration point)
5. **#120** - CAKE integration (natural after above)
