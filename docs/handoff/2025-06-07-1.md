## Completed

### Issue #26: Comprehensive Sandbox Implementation
- **Created `luca_core/sandbox/sandbox_manager.py`** with three execution strategies:
  - DockerSandboxExecutor: Maximum security with container isolation
  - ProcessSandboxExecutor: Resource-limited subprocess execution (Unix only)
  - RestrictedPythonExecutor: AST-validated Python with import restrictions
  
- **Security hardening implemented**:
  - Docker: Non-root user, dropped capabilities, PID limits, read-only filesystem
  - Process: Resource limits via setrlimit (CPU, memory, processes)
  - Restricted: Read-only builtins via MappingProxyType, AST import validation
  
- **Tests added**: `tests/test_sandbox_manager.py`
  - 29 comprehensive tests covering all strategies
  - Tests for timeout handling, resource limits, import validation
  - Concurrency tests for thread-local factory pattern
  - Docker resource metrics collection tests
  
- **Manager integration**: Updated `luca_core/manager/manager.py`
  - Added `execute_code_securely()` method
  - Integrated SandboxManager with trust levels
  
- **Documentation**: Created `docs/security/sandbox.md`
  - Comprehensive security architecture documentation
  - Threat model and trust levels
  - Usage examples and best practices

### Additional Work Completed
- Fixed issue dependency validation to parse planning documents
- Created sync script to update GitHub issues with dependencies
- Removed ruff from project (was incorrectly included)
- Simplified issue ordering with [01], [02] prefixes in GitHub
- All code formatted with black/isort, flake8 clean

## Status

### Working
- All three sandbox strategies operational
- Thread-safe execution with get_sandbox_manager()
- Resource usage tracking for Docker and Process strategies
- Import validation with custom **import** for restricted execution
- Platform detection (Process strategy disabled on Windows)
- All tests passing (29/29)

### Known Limitations
- Process sandboxing only works on Unix-like systems
- Docker sandbox requires Docker to be installed and running
- Docker startup has ~300-600ms overhead
- Resource limits may vary by OS (handled gracefully)

### Security Considerations
- Sandbox strategy 'NONE' is explicitly blocked
- All strategies default to no network access
- Docker uses minimal Alpine image with security hardening
- Restricted Python blocks all imports not explicitly allowed
- Resource limits prevent DOS attacks

## Critical Notes

### Security
- The `exec()` usage in RestrictedPythonExecutor is intentional and marked with nosec
- The `/tmp` mount in Docker is intentional for tmpfs, marked with nosec
- All user code is validated before execution
- No persistent filesystem access from sandboxes

### Breaking Changes
- None - this is a new feature

### Performance
- Docker: ~300-600ms startup overhead
- Process: ~50-100ms startup overhead  
- Restricted: ~10-20ms startup overhead
- All strategies enforce timeout limits

## Next Session

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create PR for sandbox implementation
2. Get CTO approval on security implementation
3. Wire sandbox into LUCA's command API (after security approval)
4. Add integration tests with actual AutoGen agents

### Future Enhancements
- WebAssembly sandbox for browser execution
- gVisor integration for enhanced container security
- Resource usage prediction and anomaly detection
- Fine-grained capability management

### Related Issues
- #120 (Interrupt system) - Will use sandbox for safe execution
- #50 (Testing framework) - Sandbox enables safe test execution
- #51 (Plugin system) - Plugins will run in sandbox
