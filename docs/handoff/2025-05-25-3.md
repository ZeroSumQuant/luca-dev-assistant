# Handoff Document - 2025-05-25 Session 3

## Session Summary
Implemented comprehensive documentation validation system using JSON schemas to enforce documentation standards before PR creation, preventing undocumented changes from being merged.

## Work Completed

### 1. JSON Schema Infrastructure (Issue #96)
- Created `schemas/handoff_schema.json` defining required handoff sections
- Created `schemas/task_log_schema.json` for task log structure validation
- Created `schemas/pr_readiness_schema.json` to enforce PR requirements
- All schemas use JSON Schema draft-07 specification

### 2. Validation Implementation
- Built `tools/validate_documentation.py` with DocumentationValidator class
- Validates task logs have entries for current date
- Validates handoff documents exist with required sections
- Checks PR readiness across multiple dimensions (docs, tests, coverage, quality)
- Added jsonschema==4.24.0 dependency

### 3. Integration with Safety Pipeline
- Updated `safety-check.sh` to include schema validation step
- Created `tools/pr_create_wrapper.sh` to enforce validation before PR creation
- Added validation scripts to coverage exclusions

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Created missing handoff document for session 2 work
- Updated task log with comprehensive session details
- Task log now tracks morning, afternoon, and evening work

## Key Decisions
- Used JSON Schema for flexible, standardized validation
- Made documentation validation mandatory in safety pipeline
- Chose to validate structure rather than just file existence
- Decided to block PR creation entirely if docs incomplete

## Current State
- All documentation validation working and tested
- Safety pipeline now includes 10 checks total
- PR creation wrapper ready but not yet enforced
- Coverage maintained at 97.34%

## Next Steps
1. Create alias or git hook to use pr_create_wrapper.sh
2. Add more detailed schema validation rules
3. Consider automated handoff generation templates
4. Test with Claude Squad instances

## Issues/Concerns
- Need to educate Claude Squad about documentation requirements
- Schema validation adds ~1-2 seconds to safety checks
- Should consider if schemas are too strict/loose

## For Next Session
- Test documentation validation with real Claude Squad usage
- Consider adding schema validation for other doc types
- Implement automated documentation templates
- Review if current schemas catch all important cases
