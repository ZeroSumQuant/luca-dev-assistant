# Luca Dev Assistant Handoff (May 8, 2025)

## Session Snapshot

Today's session focused on implementing the recommended fixes for CI test hanging issues. Based on the research document "Why Your Tests Hang in CI but Work Perfectly on Your Machine" and the previous handoff, we've added robust timeout handling, proper test isolation, and improved CI configurations.

## Current Project Status

- **Repository Location**: `/Users/dustinkirby/dev/luca-dev-assistant/`
- **Current Branch**: `claude-2025-05-06-fix-linting`
- **Latest Commit**: The changes haven't been committed yet - they include CI reliability enhancements

## Key Issues Addressed & Fixes Applied

### 1. Added pytest-timeout Plugin

- **Problem**: Tests would hang indefinitely without a timeout mechanism
- **Fix Applied**: Added pytest-timeout dependency and implemented timeout annotations
- **Files Modified**:
  - `requirements.txt`: Added pytest-timeout and psutil dependencies
  - `tests/test_luca_smoke.py`: Added explicit test timeout

### 2. Created Comprehensive Environment Configuration

- **Problem**: Test environment wasn't being properly isolated and configured
- **Fix Applied**: Created a conftest.py file to set up a consistent test environment
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `tests/conftest.py`: Added environment variable setup, multiprocessing configuration, and CI-specific settings

### 3. Improved CI Workflow

- **Problem**: CI pipeline lacked proper timeout settings and diagnostics
- **Fix Applied**: Enhanced the CI workflow with better timeouts, memory monitoring, and diagnostics
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Added global job timeout, memory diagnostics, and explicit test command with timeout

### 4. Fixed test_luca_smoke.py

- **Problem**: Smoke test was not respecting testing mode environment variable
- **Fix Applied**: Completely rewrote the test to use environment variables and explicit timeouts
- **Files Modified**:
  - `tests/test_luca_smoke.py`: Updated to properly check for testing mode and avoid launching UI

## Implementation Details

### 1. pytest-timeout Configuration

Added pytest-timeout with the thread method as recommended. This provides two critical benefits:

- Force-terminates hanging tests after a configured timeout
- Captures detailed stack traces of all threads when a timeout occurs

```python
@pytest.mark.timeout(10)  # 10-second timeout for this test
def test_luca_cli_runs():
    # Test code...
```

### 2. conftest.py Implementation

Created a robust test configuration that:

- Always sets LUCA_TESTING=1 for all test runs
- Configures the multiprocessing start method to "spawn" for better reliability
- Adds special CI-specific configurations when running in CI environments
- Provides a resource_fixture example showing proper resource cleanup

### 3. CI Workflow Enhancements

Updated the GitHub Actions workflow with:

- Global job timeout (15 minutes)
- Memory monitoring using psutil
- Verbose test output
- Environment variables for testing mode and CI detection

## Verification

All tests are now passing locally with the new timeout and testing infrastructure. The warning about "Unknown pytest.mark.timeout" has been resolved with the addition of the pytest-timeout plugin.

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   - These changes need to be committed and pushed to the branch
   - A pull request can then be created to merge them into main

2. **Create ROADMAP.md**:
   - Create a roadmap document outlining the remaining tasks for MVP completion
   - Include future development plans based on the handoff document

3. **Monitor CI Pipeline**:
   - After pushing the changes, monitor the CI pipeline to ensure tests no longer hang
   - If issues persist, review the stack traces provided by pytest-timeout

## Ready-Up Checklist

- [x] Add pytest-timeout dependency
- [x] Create conftest.py for test environment configuration
- [x] Update test_luca_smoke.py with proper timeouts
- [x] Enhance GitHub Actions workflow
- [x] Verify all tests pass locally
- [x] Update task_log.md with the implemented changes
- [ ] Commit and push changes to the branch
- [ ] Create ROADMAP.md

## Next Developer Focus

When resuming this project, focus on creating the ROADMAP.md document and monitoring the CI pipeline to ensure the tests no longer hang. If the CI pipeline is now passing reliably, the focus should shift to completing the remaining MVP features.
