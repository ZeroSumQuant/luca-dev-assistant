# Pending GitHub Issues

This document lists TODO items found in the codebase that should be converted to GitHub issues for better tracking and visibility. After creating each issue on GitHub, mark it as completed in this document.

## AutoGen Agent Orchestration

**File**: `luca.py`  
**Line**: 56  
**TODO**: Replace placeholder with actual AutoGen agent orchestration  

**Description**:  
Currently, the `process_prompt` function in `luca.py` has a placeholder implementation that simply echoes the user prompt and launches the UI. This needs to be replaced with proper AutoGen agent orchestration to process user prompts effectively.

**Tasks**:
- Implement agent initialization and configuration
- Create a conversation flow between agents
- Set up proper termination conditions
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Add timeout mechanisms to prevent hanging

**Priority**: High  
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `core-functionality`

## MCP HTTP Connection Implementation

**File**: `tools/mcp_client.py`  
**Line**: 55  
**TODO**: Implement HTTP connection  

**Description**:  
The MCP Client Manager currently only supports stdio connections to MCP servers. HTTP connection support needs to be implemented to allow for more flexible deployment scenarios, including connecting to remote MCP servers.

**Tasks**:
- Implement HTTP connection logic using the MCP client library
- Add proper error handling for HTTP-specific issues
- Add retry logic for network failures
- Include connection timeout handling
- Update documentation to reflect both connection types

**Priority**: Medium  
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `mcp-integration`

## MCP Configuration Loading

**File**: `tools/mcp_client.py`  
**Line**: 157  
**TODO**: Load from config file  

**Description**:  
The `initialize_default_servers` function needs to be implemented to load MCP server configurations from a config file. This will allow for persistent server configurations rather than hardcoding connections.

**Tasks**:
- Create a schema for MCP server configuration
- Implement configuration loading from YAML or JSON
- Support environment variable interpolation
- Add validation for loaded configurations
- Include error handling for missing or malformed configs

**Priority**: Medium  
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `mcp-integration`

## Agent Call Implementation in UI

**File**: `app/main.py`  
**Line**: 77  
**TODO**: Replace with actual agent call  

**Description**:  
The Streamlit UI currently has a placeholder response for chat messages. This needs to be replaced with actual calls to the Luca agent system to process user requests.

**Tasks**:
- Implement async agent call mechanism
- Add streaming response support
- Create proper UI feedback during processing
- Handle errors gracefully in the UI
- Maintain conversation context between calls

**Priority**: High  
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `ui`

## Agent Configuration Update Implementation

**File**: `app/pages/agent_manager.py`  
**Line**: 216  
**TODO**: Implement actual agent configuration update  

**Description**:  
The "Apply Changes" button in the Agent Manager page currently only shows a success message but doesn't actually update the agent configuration in the runtime system. This needs to be implemented to make the UI controls functional.

**Tasks**:
- Create a mechanism to update agent configuration at runtime
- Implement proper validation before applying changes
- Add confirmation for changes with potential side effects
- Create proper error handling for failed updates
- Ensure configuration changes persist across sessions

**Priority**: Medium  
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `ui`
