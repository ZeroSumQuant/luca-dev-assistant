# LUCA Dev Assistant Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the short-term and long-term development plans for the LUCA Dev Assistant project. It prioritizes tasks based on their importance for reaching MVP status and future development stages.

## Current Status

LUCA Dev Assistant is approximately 85% of the way to MVP status. The core functionality and UI components have been implemented, but there are still some CI issues and missing features that need to be addressed.

## 1. Immediate Goals (MVP Completion)

These tasks must be completed to reach the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) milestone:

- [x] Fix hanging tests in CI environment
- [x] Add proper timeout configuration
- [x] Create robust test environment setup
- [ ] Verify CI pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Address any remaining test failures

### 1.2 Core Agent Implementation
- [ ] Complete AutoGen agent orchestration in `luca.py`
- [ ] Implement proper agent termination conditions
- [ ] Connect agent responses to Streamlit UI
- [ ] Add logging for agent actions and conversations

### 1.3 File & Project Management
- [ ] Complete safe file I/O operations
- [ ] Implement Git integration with proper error handling
- [ ] Add project initialization capabilities
- [ ] Create project templates for QuantConnect strategies

### 1.4 Documentation
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add example workflows and use cases
- [ ] Create getting started guide

## 2. Short-Term Goals (Post-MVP)

These features are planned for implementation immediately after the MVP is complete:

### 2.1 Enhanced IDE Integration
- [ ] Embed Monaco Editor for code editing
- [ ] Create a secure virtual terminal for command execution
- [ ] Add code completion and syntax highlighting

### 2.2 Security Architecture
- [ ] Implement isolated workspace model
- [ ] Use container-based execution for all code
- [ ] Create permission model for file access

### 2.3 QuantConnect-Specific Features
- [ ] Implement QC Cloud API integration
- [ ] Add back-testing result visualization
- [ ] Create strategy performance analysis tools
- [ ] Add market data access capabilities

### 2.4 Plugin System
- [ ] Design modular plugin architecture
- [ ] Create "pack" system for domain-specific extensions
- [ ] Implement auto-loading of installed packs
- [ ] Create documentation for pack development

## 3. Long-Term Vision

These features represent the long-term vision for LUCA Dev Assistant:

### 3.1 Native App Packaging
- [ ] Package as a Mac .dmg application
- [ ] Create Windows installer
- [ ] Add Linux distribution packages
- [ ] Implement auto-update capabilities

### 3.2 Advanced AI Features
- [ ] Implement multi-agent orchestration for complex tasks
- [ ] Add RAG capabilities for project-specific knowledge
- [ ] Create learning system to improve from user feedback
- [ ] Add code generation from natural language descriptions

### 3.3 Team Collaboration
- [ ] Add multi-user support
- [ ] Implement project sharing
- [ ] Create comment and feedback system
- [ ] Add version control for agent-generated artifacts

### 3.4 Enterprise Integration
- [ ] Add SSO support
- [ ] Create role-based access control
- [ ] Implement audit logging
- [ ] Add compliance and governance features

## 4. Release Timeline

## 5. Contribution Areas

The following areas welcome community contributions:

- **Tool development**: Creating new tools for agent use
- **Domain packs**: Building specialized capability packs
- **Testing**: Expanding test coverage and identifying issues
- **Documentation**: Improving user and developer docs
- **UI enhancements**: Creating better visualizations and interfaces

## 6. Success Metrics

The success of LUCA Dev Assistant will be measured by:

1. **User adoption**: Number of active users
2. **Code quality**: % of generated code that passes tests/lint
3. **Time savings**: Reduction in development time for common tasks
4. **Successful strategies**: Number of profitable trading strategies developed
5. **Community growth**: Number of contributors and extensions
