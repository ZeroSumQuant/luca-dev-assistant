# LUCA Dev Assistant Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the short-term and long-term development plans for the LUCA Dev Assistant project. It prioritizes tasks based on their importance for reaching MVP status and future development stages.

## Current Status

LUCA Dev Assistant is approximately 80% of the way to MVP status. The core functionality and UI components have been implemented, but there are still some CI issues and missing features that need to be addressed. With the refined project vision emphasizing LUCA as a general-purpose development assistant with adaptive architecture, we've added several new items to our MVP checklist.

## 1. Immediate Goals (MVP Completion)

These tasks must be completed to reach the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) milestone:

### 1.1 CI/Testing Stability (In Progress)
- [x] Fix hanging tests in CI environment
- [x] Add proper timeout configuration
- [x] Create robust test environment setup
- [ ] Verify CI pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Address any remaining test failures

### 1.2 Core Agent Implementation
- [ ] Complete AutoGen agent orchestration in `luca.py`
- [ ] Implement proper agent termination conditions
- [ ] Connect agent responses to Streamlit UI
- [ ] Add logging for agent actions and conversations
- [ ] Implement adaptive agent architecture for dynamic team composition
- [ ] Add transparent agent selection mechanism

### 1.3 File & Project Management
- [ ] Complete safe file I/O operations
- [ ] Implement Git integration with proper error handling
- [ ] Add project initialization capabilities
- [ ] Create general project templates (web, API, data pipeline)
- [ ] Create domain-specific templates (including QuantConnect strategies)

### 1.4 UI/UX Features
- [ ] Implement domain presets dropdown
- [ ] Create Noob/Pro/Guru learning mode selector
- [ ] Add mode-specific response formatting
- [ ] Create MCP server management interface
- [ ] Design agent visualization system

### 1.5 Documentation
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add example workflows and use cases
- [ ] Create getting started guide
- [ ] Document learning modes and their application

## 2. Short-Term Goals (Post-MVP)

These features are planned for implementation immediately after the MVP is complete:

### 2.1 Enhanced IDE Integration
- [ ] Embed Monaco Editor for code editing
- [ ] Create a secure virtual terminal for command execution
- [ ] Add code completion and syntax highlighting

### 2.2 Security Architecture
- [ ] Implement isolated workspace model
- [ ] Use container-based execution for all code
- [ ] Create permission model for file access

### 2.3 Domain-Specific Features
- [ ] Implement domain-specific knowledge bases
- [ ] Add domain-specific tool integrations
- [ ] Create specialized agent personas for each domain
- [ ] Implement QuantConnect Cloud API integration

### 2.4 MCP Ecosystem Expansion
- [ ] Create and document MCP server development workflow
- [ ] Implement additional MCP servers (Chroma DB, LightRAG, Graffiti)
- [ ] Create server discovery and auto-configuration mechanism
- [ ] Add MCP server monitoring and diagnostics

### 2.5 Plugin System
- [ ] Design modular plugin architecture
- [ ] Create "pack" system for domain-specific extensions
- [ ] Implement auto-loading of installed packs
- [ ] Create documentation for pack development

## 3. Long-Term Vision

These features represent the long-term vision for LUCA Dev Assistant:

### 3.1 Native App Packaging
- [ ] Package as a Mac .dmg application
- [ ] Create Windows installer
- [ ] Add Linux distribution packages
- [ ] Implement auto-update capabilities

### 3.2 Advanced AI Features
- [ ] Enhance multi-agent orchestration for complex tasks
- [ ] Expand RAG capabilities for project-specific knowledge
- [ ] Create learning system to improve from user feedback
- [ ] Add advanced code generation from natural language descriptions
- [ ] Implement context-aware agent specialization

### 3.3 Team Collaboration
- [ ] Add multi-user support
- [ ] Implement project sharing
- [ ] Create comment and feedback system
- [ ] Add version control for agent-generated artifacts

### 3.4 Enterprise Integration
- [ ] Add SSO support
- [ ] Create role-based access control
- [ ] Implement audit logging
- [ ] Add compliance and governance features

## 4. Release Timeline

- **Documentation**: Improving user and developer docs
- **UI enhancements**: Creating better visualizations and interfaces

## 6. Success Metrics

The success of LUCA Dev Assistant will be measured by:

1. **User adoption**: Number of active users across different domains
2. **Code quality**: % of generated code that passes tests/lint
3. **Time savings**: Reduction in development time for common tasks
4. **Learning effectiveness**: User progression through Noob → Pro → Guru modes
5. **Ecosystem growth**: Number of custom MCP servers and plugins developed
6. **Community growth**: Number of contributors and extensions
